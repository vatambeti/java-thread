# Java Multithreading Project ðŸš€

This Java project demonstrates core concepts of **multithreading**, covering real-world use cases such as **deadlocks**, **synchronization**, **manual locks (ReentrantLock, ReadWriteLock, Semaphore)**, and essential **thread operations**. It is ideal for learners and interview preparation.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

### âœ… 1. Thread Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a Java thread includes:
- **New** â€“ Thread is created but not started.
- **Runnable** â€“ Thread is ready to run.
- **Running** â€“ Thread is executing.
- **Blocked/Waiting** â€“ Waiting for resources or lock.
- **Terminated** â€“ Thread has completed execution.

### âœ… 2. Core Thread Methods

| Method      | Description                                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `start()`   | Starts a new thread                               |
| `run()`     | Contains the code to be executed by the thread    |
| `sleep(ms)` | Pauses execution for a specified time             |
| `yield()`   | Hints to scheduler to allow other threads to run  |
| `join()`    | Waits for another thread to finish execution      |
| `isAlive()` | Checks if a thread is still alive                 |

### âœ… 3. Synchronization

Ensures **mutual exclusion** so only one thread can access critical code:

```java
synchronized (lockObject) {
    // critical section
}
